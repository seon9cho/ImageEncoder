i d prefer to speak to you in private .
you were drunk last night weren t you ?
we ll never get through this .
it s good that i have a daughter .
i didn t know you were awake .
i d like to run a few more tests .

the students divided themselves into three groups .

he is a man of vision .
tom treats me like a child .
you must accept the king of spain as your leader .

i cooked dinner .
he draws straight lines .
i did everything in my power to protect her from you .
do you have plans for dinner ?
what makes you happy ?
a crowd soon gathered around the fire engine .
is this seat taken ?
are you sure tom is here ?
the flowers brightened up the room .
i go to school by bicycle .
a flush is a poker hand where all five cards are of the same suit .
how did you become interested in studying languages ?
what ll you give tom for christmas ?
i m sorry i didn t answer sooner .
i just don t like football .
we are not all that safe .
he was persuaded to change his mind .
she stood there even after the train was out of sight .
i thought that you were retired .
you must obey the traffic rules .
you look unsure .
you should have helped him with his work .
you have your hat on backwards .
let s go to tom s .
tom is the boy i told you about the other day .
please ask tom to leave .
are you both crazy ?
may i eat this apple ?
they won t tell you the truth .
he doesn t have a job . he s retired .
i don t know what this is about .
i don t want to talk about it further .
i talked to everybody .
you have a lot of books .
that s exactly what i was thinking .
who are these presents for ?
tom isn t a very good farmer .
you must learn from your mistakes .
just one moment please .
he doesn t like to eat fish .
i said he could go .
don t be afraid . i won t hurt you .
we don t have a car .
tom knows that i m canadian .
i wish you the best of luck .
tom built a raft .
i hope you don t mind .
all tom needed was money .
there are no breakthroughs .
you look younger .
i shook hands with tom and left .
that was a nice speech .
i can t stand it anymore .
speak quietly .
come tomorrow morning .
we nearly starved .
i couldn t let tom go without saying goodbye .
he always yells at me when he is angry .
we still don t know the truth .
you re mistaken .
don t you ever touch me again .
he says it s urgent .
he is not old enough to live alone .
i m the type who likes to think things over very carefully .
the controls of the plane were out of order .
i want to stay in america for a few years .
don t rush .
can i speak to the person in charge ?
you shouldn t see her now .
that sounded like a gunshot .
for your own safety never ride in a car with a drunk driver .
there are a lot of things i have to do .
i do want to go with you .
why don t you tell me what this is all about ?
who does this suitcase belong to ?
tell them we need an ambulance .
i didn t want to get in trouble .
someone should do something about that .
we re interested in observing the customs of different regions .
he met many fascinating people in the course of his travels .
tom has only one leg .
don t you want to know why ?
i was wrong about that .
i like this song .
if it s fine tomorrow we ll go on a picnic .
i watched tom .
colds are prevalent this winter .
don t worry . i m a doctor .
tom handed mary a pamphlet .
is tom conscious ?
stop putting off finding a job .
everything is negotiable .
i know tom is troubled .
tom continued to talk to mary .
we probably don t have enough money to buy that .
i didn t see anything strange .
tom cried all morning .
wolves won t usually attack people .
tom likes that .
i lost my favorite pen .
we apologize for this inconvenience .
it feels really good .
tom didn t want to sing .
the police lowered their weapons .
i m not against people owning guns .
i want you to meet someone .
the traveler stopped to ask me the way .
i found a real bargain .
he removed his sunglasses .
we stayed at a cheap hotel .
i m sorry but i don t speak french very well .
it s late so turn off the tv .
almost everyone participated .
tom looked at his appointment book .
you have a point there .
from now on i m going to say what s on my mind .
where do you have pain ?
don t you think most japanese students work hard ?
i don t understand why tom brought you here .
i m tom .
tom woke up at the crack of dawn .
he was playing tennis all day .
all things must pass .
i know that i didn t do that .
in fact the opposite is more likely to occur .
what did you want to tell me ?
that never even crossed my mind .
i am delighted to be here .
walking along the street i found a wallet .
i don t know why i was so nervous .
this place is really noisy .
go fly a kite .
such a case is not uncommon today .
that effort bore no fruit .
where were you coming from ?
they were not impressed .
how many dolls did you have when you were a little girl ?
that s how we do things .
you know as well as i do that tom isn t a very good singer .
we need to get going .
the troops had plenty of arms .
the prize money enabled me to go on a world cruise .
let me show you how i do it .
i don t believe in astrology .
would you like to come with us ?
you have to go .
did he tell you what to do ?
tom is sensitive .
i take a bath almost every day .
hurry up or you ll be late .
she is knitting a sweater .
you forgot to tell me to buy bread .
that s not your fault .
he cheated on me .
do you have a christmas tree ?
he stubbed out his cigar in the ashtray and stood up to leave .
you won t need those .
i pretended it didn t happen .
it s a weapon .
mother has old fashioned ideas .
i bet you re talking about tom .
i don t know what i was expecting .
you should keep your promise .
he is every inch a gentleman .
try to eat a little more .
thanks to you i have problems with my blood pressure .
tom has already finished the work .
yeah you could be right .
go to the barber .
just a second . let me finish .
don t be so angry .
tom is flabbergasted .
did you find a solution ?
what s their purpose ?
he left the room without saying a word .
why isn t there any money in my wallet ?
tom could barely hear what mary was trying to say .
it was an emergency .
what are some things that you and tom have in common ?
i think tom is drunk .
you haven t even tried .
we should go to sleep .
he hurt himself when he fell .
don t ever forget that .
i met a friend there .
just do it .
that is mine .
tom likes to do that here .
excess of politeness is annoying .
i know that you re doing your best .
he is my brother not father .
get into the car .
i made breakfast .
i love orange marmalade .
an apple fell off the tree .
this is no longer for sale .
i know tom will be objective .
tom said he thought that pair of shoes were too expensive .
i m not going to pass out .
since i had a cold i was absent from school .
why don t you give us a moment to talk ?
let us out of here .
we re at war .
the weather is good today .
i agree with you .
did you have any luck ?
is it far ?
he had no particular reason to go there .
i ve been there before .
i intended to go straight back home but i sort of wandered inside a bookstore .
why didn t you listen to your father ?
i hope it was only an accident .
it s two o clock in the morning .
why are you so busy ?
it s not safe to text while you drive .
his parents go to church every sunday .
you re too skinny .
i ll be your teacher .
this is the hardest question .
tom won t go to boston without mary .
my arm hurts .
you don t have to talk about it if you don t want to .
armenia is a mountainous country .
there was no money left in my wallet .
we have plenty of time tonight .
i leave in the morning .
all the people who go to church believe in god .
he took a notebook out .
who s the fastest one here ?
the books are on the table .
avoid cliches .
no two snowflakes are exactly alike .
this is my brother tom .
please don t forget to put a stamp on the letter before mailing it .
what gift would you like to receive for christmas ?
he s a historian .
they let me go .
when i got up the sun was already high in the sky .
tom is ill at ease among strangers .
sorry i didn t mean to interrupt .
you re not allowed to eat those .
we ll need more food than that .
i don t need a boyfriend .
there s no choice .
if you don t leave i m calling the cops .
we drank champagne last christmas .
i just finished cleaning the garage .
we had a lot of rain last month .
the boy caught a large fish .
charge this bill to me .
i m assuming you have a plan .
i cannot accept this gift .
i was embarrassed when he talked to me .
tom is puzzled .
that has happened to me several times .
you have a little fever today don t you ?
i want to sit down .
i can t help you today .
what are you going to do with it ?
i believe you are incorrect .
someone called tom .
i can t help but feel a little relieved .
could you turn the volume down ?
i have to win .
there ve been times when that s happened .
his health has declined since the accident .
i turned right .
could you get me some cough drops ?
you need a joystick .
you can get a loan from a bank .
i have a lot of old books . a couple of them are quite valuable .
we can t rush these things .
i ll go if you go .
didn t you read the prospectus ?
i can t help but feel partly responsible .
can they give you something for that ?
i ve got something to show you .
you should protect your eyes from direct sunlight .
after the war he managed to escape to south america .
tom thinks we should leave early .
i am staying for another few weeks .
the station is in the center of the city .
if you need a ride i could come and get you .
tom s room is tidy .
i m very sorry for being late .
everyone rushed outside .
it was easy for me to do that .
what time did you wake up this morning ?
you have caused me to lose my temper .
you will need an armed escort .
he asked a question about it .
you re being bossy aren t you ?
you should stick those pictures in your album .
are you bringing anyone ?
was there much damage ?
what time did your friend go home ?
there are members in the club .
tom asked mary to get him a cup of coffee .
she asked him not to leave her alone .
they found out .
money isn t everything .
where exactly are you ?
no one believed that .
now that he is old it is your duty to look after him .
i spent yesterday reading instead of going out .
why didn t you apply for the job ?
they stayed at a luxury hotel .
we need to do it immediately .
i do remember the incident quite well .
nobody here smokes .
so what were we talking about ?
life imitates art more often than the other way around .
you re lucky tom lent you some money .
it s very dangerous .
you re not that smart .
i have some stuff to do at home .
in my opinion he s right .
i had nowhere to go .
she wants to know who sent the flowers .
do you keep a dream diary ?
i fell asleep around midnight .
the bus driver didn t see the pedestrian .
i have allergies .
the fuel gauge is broken .
i m ready to leave this place .
tell me this isn t happening .
excuse me what s going on ?
i still have some work to do .
they were very confused .
we don t like rain .
i wonder what happened .
i uploaded three videos to youtube today .
has it arrived ?
i need to go shopping .
how can you not like him ?
tom is sitting in the conference room .
when do you mean to start ?
tom never spoke french .
because of the bad weather the plane s departure was delayed by two hours .
you said you needed someone to protect you .
don t be mean .
it s what you deserve .
the girls weren t afraid but the boys were .
would you like to rephrase the question ?
i feel like having an ice cream .
the policeman visited all the houses .
tom contacted mary .
we often played chess after school .
ignore tom .
did tom drown ?
i appreciate your patience .
i was born and brought up in matsuyama .
i apologize for what s happened here .
i had a headache so i couldn t do that .
never play here .
i think you re a genius .
there was no warning whatsoever .
maybe it s not as hard as it looks .
i have a large collection of stamps .
keep the dog out .
he called me a cab .
i am glad to hear the news .
he does not study hard enough .
that must be a misprint .
it s really fun .
he got in english .
don t do that . it s not your job .
it was a good idea .
is anything the matter ?
i had some work that i needed to do .
they have a dream .
i would never do it again .
stay a moment .
you look happy .
he did a real snow job on my daughter .
doing good work is always difficult .
can you go faster ?
it was not at all funny .
he grew up to be an engineer .
i d like to open a savings account .
tom should ve been helping me .
he took the public by surprise .
she demanded to see the person in charge .
tom had his car key in his left hand .
boil some water .
she wanted a piece of cake but there was none left .
unfortunately the ambulance arrived too late .
everyone was invited except for me .
where s the nearest drugstore ?
i think we may have something that you d be interested in buying .
what did you do this summer ?
she can t bear the noise .
i just thought you were happy .
i take full responsibility for this .
that ll never fly .
i d like a word with you in private .
you seem distant .
would you consider this a good proposal ?
i m pleased to see you .
you didn t get very far .
i paid for the drinks .
what do you intend to do ?
i thought you might change your mind .
i bought a new car .
they found no such proof .
i forgot to feed my dog .
can t you speak french ?
think about what you want .
they lost .
no person achieves success or happiness when compelled to do what he naturally dislikes to do .
modern cats don t eat mice .
they made the decision .
let me handle this .
he s a lovely young man .
have you ever been in prison ?
he s a man of his word .
i d like to talk to you .
so what happened ?
tom approved .
the weather is cold all year here .
do you know of an apartment i can rent that allows pets ?
i hope you have a wonderful evening .
i m sorry to bother you but we ve got a small problem .
i just figured out who you are .
i am from spain .
i can buy what i need on my way home .
don t tell me . let me guess .
i can t talk to girls .
he ripped his shirt open .
shouldn t we give tom a chance ?
how long are you going to stay ?
i ve been looking all over for you .
she slept for a few hours .
neither of my brothers will be there .
she invited me to the ballet .
i know what you re thinking .
be still .
you don t seem too sure .
heaven knows why .
this was not supposed to happen .
he s a senior .
get on with it .
i just want to have a little fun .
you have a choice to make .
look back !
that s his private website .
some of them are teachers .
he had to find another way .
i wanted to have children .
she doesn t understand me either .
tom is nearby .
you were happy weren t you ?
i hope we re not too late .
i don t think i can help you on monday .
he has a strong body .
take a card .
tom stayed .
she was wearing a strange hat .
are you ready to go ?
i heard an explosion .
are you sure you don t want to do this ?
everybody should do that .
i think they like us .
they re behind us .
i don t think anybody s going to help you .
are you dating anyone ?
hold this while i tie my shoes .
make yourself at home .
don t you think this suits me ?
i don t have a sword .
bradford is arguably the ugliest town in britain .
where s your drink ?
she told the child to eat up the food .
you should ve taken the money .
hold this while i tie my shoes .
you re to do as i tell you .
how many christmas carols can you sing by heart ?
tom will be back next week .
when i opened the door i broke the lock .
are you seeing anybody ?
how many christmas presents did you give this year ?
write something .
we ll see what they want .
i have been expecting you .
how do you calculate the volume of a cube ?
i ll go next month .
i will be through with the book in no time .
why would you ask that ?
you can rent a boat by the hour .
the man is right .
this intersection is dangerous .
he is not as tall as his father .
does your girlfriend like flowers ?
he must be crazy to treat his parents like this .
i can survive .
everyone knows bell invented the telephone .
where do we go from here ?
our team is still undefeated .
they hid in the cellar .
when you leave i ll miss you .
i wasn t conscious of anyone watching me .
i know a guy who s never seen snow .
that sounds horrible .
some parts of this city are very ugly .
i m getting off at the next station .
the servant swept the floor .
tom is on the bus with mary .
i don t need a history lesson .
what time is dinner ?
tom had lipstick all over his face .
i run every day .
he wants to kiss her .
that shop has many customers .
that s how i would do it .
you were beginning to worry me .
you can t do that here .
he did not come back before ten o clock .
i ve had a lot of calls today .
i pretended that i didn t see it .
i learned a valuable lesson today .
he was too busy to notice it .
you ve done the best you can do .
you don t know tom as well as i do .
they have enough capital to build a second factory .
give me a second .
tom wore goggles .
i d be delighted .
that s as good a place as any .
i thought i would find you there .
i m tall .
i ve asked you this question before .
he was very naughty when he was a little boy .
the complaint is under investigation .
you should ve done that by yourself .
tom doesn t seem busy .
how did you come by this painting ?
he aspires to become a teacher .
i thought you d enjoy that .
my father was an engineer .
oh i haven t decided what i m going to do yet .
i cannot help wondering if he will come on time .
he does not seem to be able to catch on to what she is saying .
that s very thoughtful of you .
i like to shop at that department store .
i ll ask you one last time .
how much money have you made so far ?
i didn t see you until now .
what choices do we have ?
we haven t done that in a while .
she is firmly determined to own a store of her own .
my figures don t seem to tally with yours .
it s better to be a winner than a loser .
it may have been tom who broke this window .
tell tom i don t know where he parked his car .
just be careful .
it s just like a nightmare .
you get used to it .
do you like your classmates ?
would you please not leave the door open ?
i am thinking of going abroad .
cover your eyes .
she couldn t put up with his rudeness any more .
our guest is waiting for us downstairs .
i feel kind of sick .
here s the key to your room .
it doesn t look right .
didn t i tell you that i was allergic to peanuts ?
let s talk about it when we get home .
as soon as i got home the telephone rang .
i bought mary a scarf .
the marathon will be held rain or shine .
this is cool .
it s nice to see you again .
i have to dress up .
his sister is not going to america .
she got wet to the skin .
i did everything i could to be your friend .
we haven t talked to each other since the accident .
you dropped something .
who is going to speak tonight ?
stay away from my daughter !
there s something i need to tell you before you leave .
we had a slight difference of opinion .
i finally caught up with my friends .
you don t even know why i m here .
i took for granted that he got homesick .
he has been dead for five years .
i don t need a babysitter .
does your mother know about this ?
are you home ?
i just don t want your dog in my house .
do i look dead to you ?
i apologize to all of you .
have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant ?
i d like you to have dinner with me .
let s take a rest .
let go of the handle .
tom rummaged through the drawer looking for a pencil .
don t stand near me .
if he had worked harder he could have succeeded .
i never thought i d see your face again .
your trousers are dirty .
i did what i was told .
how long were you at school today ?
i hope the weather will be good .
we saw guards coming toward us so we hid in the bushes .
is there something you want to tell me ?
i like this color .
i don t know what you heard about me .
from an objective viewpoint his argument was far from rational .
i suggest we change clothes first .
i m not going to close the door .
we are accustomed to wearing shoes .
tom said that mary wasn t surprised .
she s asking how that s possible .
did you get a christmas present from tom this year ?
do you enjoy studying ?
my eyes are sore .
they were different .
apart from a couple of early setbacks the project is progressing well .
i m economically independent of my parents .
that tie suits you very well .
he is said to have been very poor when he was young .
tom and mary both work full time .
i can do without this .
i don t really want to go there by myself .
do you still want to be an officer ?
you re old enough to know better .
tom voted .
american politics are interesting to watch especially during a presidential election .
it s useless to try and resist .
i m interfering .
i m not old enough .
there is a friendly atmosphere in the office .
two months have passed since he left for france .
a few people came to the lecture .
who s in command here ?
whatever you do don t pull this rope .
the meeting went on until noon .
i wish i had asked you for advice .
they re related to each other .
tom will never know .
sit down tom .
it was a bitter pill to swallow .
i took the train which was ten minutes late .
i m happy you re here .
i must find some new friends .
the medieval era gave way to the renaissance .
i m not interested in your opinion .
we lost .
is something bothering you ?
i can t praise him enough .
it was so good .
i want you to call off the fight .
tom and mary have gone .
you should relax a bit .
we went swimming at the beach .
it s difficult to help people that don t want your help .
i m a sound sleeper .
i never go on vacation without my cellphone .
i felt sorry for her when i heard her story .
he wants to be an engineer .
the problem is theirs .
something s happening here .
tom continued driving .
i m no friend of yours .
enjoy yourself for a change .
i thought you were injured .
i want to go with you tonight .
he lived in spain i think .
is everybody ready ?
i can almost touch the ceiling .
may i visit you tomorrow ?
whoever stole the money should be punished .
i m sure i ll be fine .
your name is tom right ?
i came here to save you .
i don t know if i can handle this alone .
does he speak english ?
this is an important night .
hang on a second .
they didn t obey their parents .
i want to convey my sympathy .
i think i ve had one too many .
they all drowned .
you really are pathetic .
help me make a list .
at least no one was hurt .
she gave him everything she owned .
this book is very good .
i ate a hamburger for lunch .
we got off on the wrong foot .
the neighbors called the police .
let me help you with your baggage .
i m not staying here .
i must work tomorrow .
we should leave immediately .
you re still green .
we weren t invited to the opening ceremony .
you know it doesn t matter .
they held hands .
i m popular .
i m innocent .
if for some reason a man stopped thinking that man would no longer be a man .
they did it in front of the staff .
he couldn t go out because of the snow .
do you feel it too ?
tom hopes he doesn t become a workaholic like his father .
tom and mary both know that that s not true .
i don t know what this sentence means .
it s another ball of wax .
this is very useful .
do i look like a plumber ?
i m wasting my time .
what re you all dressed up for ?
do you mind if i help myself ?
there are cases where honesty doesn t pay .
i was profoundly disturbed by this news .
watch the road .
you didn t tell me everything .
the situation got out of their control .
i ve never taught anyone anything .
they re not expensive .
you will not be able to catch the train .
a brass band is marching along the street .
i have a new book i m working on .
open your book to page ten .
i know that tom might want to learn how to do that .
i d like to help but i ve got an important meeting to attend .
we want peace .
this pen doesn t write well .
he s the laziest person i know .
give the book to whomever wants it .
so what are you talking about ?
i ve been calling all day .
last summer i worked part time on a farm .
they want more space .
he goes to bed early but it takes him a long time to get to sleep .
how will i recognize you ?
i walked along the river .
you should bone up on your french before your trip to marseille .
i know that you don t know how to speak french .
is that your own idea ?
i m nervous when speaking in another language .
some of these apples are bad .
he got hooked on drugs at a young age .
you ll know soon enough .
she gave an oral report to her boss .
nice seeing you !
i m not married anymore .
i received a letter in english yesterday .
i will get you a bike for your birthday .
i almost caught the ball .
this is my money .
i admire his talent .
tom smells awful .
i ll make you some coffee .
something is the matter with this tv set .
do you see the entrance of the park ?
you can t tell anyone about this .
that s a plan .
you may stay here as long as you like .
she wept bitterly .
you don t need to be in such a hurry .
the weather changed suddenly .
i can t remember the last time i ate with my family .
she didn t have any pencils .
each of the three boys won a prize .
why did you stop only the foreigners ?
get out .
all of us were shocked by the news .
please refrain from smoking here .
i d be surprised if they asked me to give a speech .
i know that tom is frantic .
who are you working for now ?
that s not uncommon .
does everybody understand ?
they walked down the street singing a song .
i know that wasn t the right thing to do .
i know that you still love me .
i don t think i snore .
i can t express myself in english very well .
i only got your letter yesterday .
i like your beard .
there isn t much furniture in my room .
it sounds like french .
tom didn t die in vain .
you re not a teenager yet .
do ants have ears ?
my father made me what i am .
please come on time .
he left three days ago .
i only wish i were able to help .
the accident happened at that intersection .
it looked like no one could stop president reagan .
she brags about how well she can cook .
colds are contagious .
i know you want to be rich .
you must remove your shoes when you enter a japanese house .
i wanted to watch that movie with you .
she was painfully thin .
the eerie silence struck terror into their hearts .
it was very disappointing .
our ultimate goal is to establish world peace .
who sent you here ?
it s fun to ride a motorcycle .
tom likes classical music .
i don t want to wear a wig .
do you like roller coasters ?
their meeting was inevitable .
i haven t yet given up .
both of the girls are wearing white suits .
do you have a moment ?
he denies having done it .
mary looks like her mother .
you don t have to wait until the end .
tom no longer goes out with mary .
i m sorry i yelled at you .
stop the car now .
he is not my son but my nephew .
i wanted to show it to you .
that sounds outrageous .
you re not married are you ?
tom didn t even say he was sorry .
we are busy people .
i am harvesting wheat .
stay close .
she knit him a sweater .
what are the conditions ?
the union was modest in its wage demands .
would you forgive me ?
my parents don t like the way i dress .
it s time to go to sleep .
you d make a good grandfather .
mary won t listen to her friend s advice .

that young lady is a nurse .
how do i get to the beach ?
tom never told me why he didn t like mary .
it doesn t fit .
i want a box three times as large as this .

tom lives on a private island .
he filled the bottle with water .

tom was silent for a moment .
she s a dog .
tom took my money .
this didn t surprise me .

he reached for the dictionary .
i want to know who was in charge .
i must leave .
is that so ?
tom may do whatever he wants .
i saw tom kissing john s wife .
he s an excellent kisser .
stop deluding yourself .
did you really expect him to tell you the truth ?
tom is supposed to do that without any help .
she ate her dinner .
paparazzi thronged both sides of the red carpet .
i m not the one who should be doing this .

the dog is ours .
a university job would give you a lot more free time .

she was more beautiful than all of the others .

i didn t need to pay for the food .

i choose to believe you .
i doubt that s what really happened .

weather permitting let s go on a picnic .

i ll work as long as i live .
get out .
this is no longer funny .
tom is rested .
my sister irons my pants .
it s a conspiracy .
he shall have it .
i don t know how to address you .
asking a woman how old she is is not a good idea .
he can bend an iron rod with his hands .
i remember when it happened .
don t sit on that bench .
enjoy the show .
i haven t seen you in weeks .
could you send up some stomach medicine ?
tom pushed against the door with all his weight .

i didn t know how to do it but i was willing to give it a try .
are you sure you don t want to live at home with your parents ?
we re on schedule .
i got tired of waiting .
i m listening .
i m afraid i can t let you do that .
in spite of the fact that she was busy she came to see me .
it made me laugh out loud .
may i have this book ?

as soon as she heard the bell ring she answered the telephone .
i really like my coworkers .
the university bears the name of its founder .
we don t have the money .

i didn t say it was easy .
he makes believe he is rich .
he kept walking all the day .

tom disappointed mary .
my parents know about it .
it s excruciatingly slow .
he didn t dare say anything .
get out of the van .
play that song again .
beware of pickpockets here .
they don t really care .
the town is beautiful .
they asked for my help .
this milk tastes odd .
tom speaks french much better than he speaks english .

fruit tends to rot right away .

i really miss them .
i ve been here for a year .
can you remember the first word you learned in english ?

he was made to do it against his will .
the pirates buried their treasure in the ground .

you re supposed to say yes .
you seem depressed .
five gallons of regular please .

i ve always been interested in science .
tom is proud of you .
i didn t want you to miss your bus .
tom made some scrambled eggs .
i don t have a cent .
i m greedy .

i have a rough idea where it is .
would you like a glass of orange juice with your breakfast ?

everyone loves their father .
mom and dad are very nervous .
they should be fine .
i had to walk because there were no taxis .
i d like to have a word with you .
tom did something strange .
we re not desperate yet .
tom is the person i saw yesterday .
i m a member of the sales department .
i just want you to be prepared .
tom lived in australia until a few years ago .
i realize i m just stating the obvious .
i need to ask you something .
not all blondes are dumb .
ronald reagan was born in in the little town of tampico illinois .
i am not a morning person .
he has never played golf .
my brother is good at mathematics .

how good are you ?
tom won t let me speak french .
i still need to talk to you .
it s been three years since i ve seen tom .
if you run into trouble i ll help and so will my father .
there is a knife missing .
tom is still crying .
you have friends who can help you don t you ?
i don t see what you two are so happy about .
she was able to solve the problem in ten minutes .
i catch the flu every year .
the girls all laughed .
i think you need to find yourself a part time job .
do you buy that explanation ?
i m not so convinced .
i can t focus on two things at the same time .
you can t keep something that big a secret .
i want to please you .
just do your job .
he made up that story .
there is no urgency .
she made the same mistake again .
he is my friend . do you guys know him ?
i ll see you there .
i have had quite enough of his jokes .
the glass is empty .
yesterday i bought a book .
please sit here .
be confident .
i m not going to stay forever .
this fell off a truck .
i ve had a busy morning .
we had next to nothing in the kitchen .
you re nervous .
look out of the window .
tom seems reasonable .
help yourself to a piece of cake .
this camera is tom s .
do you know the man staring at you ?
there were no other survivors .
tom seemed a bit disoriented .
i told the children to be quiet but they just kept on being noisy .
be kind to those around you .
i ve already tried that once .
tom didn t want his friends to see him cry .
can eating just vegetables help you lose weight ?
tom asked mary for some help .
do you work here ?
i rewrote my report .
he arrived at the station out of breath .
i don t know about you but i m starved .
it s simple .
we need a distraction .
how d it work out ?
wearing glasses makes you look more intellectual .
i want to speak french .
i like to sit in the front of the bus .
he let me go .
tom sent mary money .
no way !
i ll meet you down at the station tomorrow .
tom has gained weight .
i realized what was happening .
i want to know more about you .
i used to hate you .
he kissed her again .
at least try to come on time .
you re so mean .
what a funny man !
i am in a spot .
we ve just cleaned the toilets .
we don t do that very often .
how did you get to know about her ?
if you go by bus you can get there in about one third of the time .
they were afraid of you .
i m going to have to think about that one .
i m eating an apple .
the novel was published after his death .
you can save your breath . there is no use talking to him .
i think it s highly unlikely that you ll be able to do that by yourself .
i came here to tell you something important .
the recent shortage of coffee has given rise to a lot of problems .
i have an older brother and an older sister .
i ll never be able to do that without your help .
i ve already packed my things .
his dream came true .
i just want to check something .
what are you guys up to ?
tom tripped over something .
you should try to see it .
somebody is in our garage .
i m sure i m right .
tell tom that everyone is here .
i apologized profusely .
you re exhausted .
i was unable to go to his birthday party .
the chief justice will swear in the president .
this is a misunderstanding .
they were scolded by the teacher .
the rich are not always happier than the poor .
i d like you to be my guest tonight .
i pay most of my bills on the first of each month .
i wonder what tom would do .
are you going to sit with me ?
people can easily tell the difference between them .
she squeezed a lemon for tea .
i can t let you go in there alone .
you ll be crying before long .
let s not discuss this in front of the children .
tom wanted to be a poet .
he stayed at a hotel for a couple of days .
she left her ticket at home .
don t even bother coming .
it would be best if you didn t do that .
do i know you ?
someone broke my camera .
the answer to your question is no .
i usually stay indoors on sunday .
the storm has died down .
i got up to go and look outside .
call a doctor .
what have you done with the books ?
if she expects them to give her five days off work with pay she s going to be disappointed .
i advise you never to live beyond your income .
nobody wants to work outdoors on a cold day .
he s already left .
we want everybody to have a good christmas .
that was one of the biggest mistakes in my life .
where are our friends ?
you always destroy everything .
do you know the man staring at you ?
could i have money for my piano lesson ?
i can t figure out what s causing the problem .
it s an outrage .
i just got a job .
i want to make sure you are who you say you are .
i always keep a dictionary close at hand .
explain what that means .
i m unhappy .
she will be here before long .
apart from a few mistakes your composition was excellent .
tom helped us all .
i was so excited that i couldn t fall asleep .
there are few sounds in this world more beautiful than a baby s laugh .
i will do that work on condition that i get paid for it .
i m a little bit tired today .
he will not do it anymore .
i made dinner .
the doctor advised me to take up some sport to stay in shape .
i ve been asked to become the manager .
he has a lot more money than i have .
i took that picture a week ago .
i thought it might be you .
he s three years older than me .
are you blushing ?
what department do you work for ?
i wonder if dinner is ready .
i hope to see you again before long .
can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant ?
the curtains are fireproof .
she is stubborn .
world war i broke out in .
you look familiar . do i know you ?
where do i sleep ?
what bugged me most was having been deceived .
i can t explain it to you .
he has two cats .
i met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely .
don t scare me like that !
tom is seated .
he lives in osaka .
he drank beer .
it s one of my favorites .
i know you want to make me happy .
the contest ends tomorrow .
could you talk a little slower ?
i m going to put a curse on you .
the choice is all up to you .
america did away with slavery .
it s very risky .
where are they swimming ?
i don t have an appointment .
i don t have any money .
i m not mad .
that s all you can do .
look at me when i talk to you !
i don t want to get my feet wet .
she had a good time talking with him about his trip .
put on a nice dress .
i heard what happened at school .
i ll phone you later .
let s welcome our guests .
i was about to leave when you telephoned .
don t be so impatient .
it s a no brainer .
where is it located ?
i was upstairs .
have you ever forgotten your phone number ?
i hope you re right .
i was mr . jackson s student .
i have plenty of things to eat in the pantry .
does he live here ?
i don t think either of us wants that to happen .
we ll work the problem out .
i m looking forward to doing that .
first you must protect yourself .
tom always speaks french .
come on trust me .
i need your help to find tom .
you re no different .
i ll be back in a few months .
i ll give you a lift home .
let s go sit in the shade .
how embarrassing !
don t be such a fool .
you must tell me .
the kitten lapped up the milk i poured into the saucer .
we should hang out .
i didn t expect you to turn up here .
my arms are aching .
i appreciate your vigilance .
write this down .
i will go rain or shine .
you re double parked .
two thousand people fit into this hall .
is there a student discount ?
i m sure that s not true .
he was distracted by the beautiful girl .
we re counting on you to help .
i was actually kind of serious .
the man committed murder .
i like your dress .
our dorm s heating system isn t working properly .
have a look .
we left home early in the morning .
he said he knows this secret .
if you don t want to go you don t have to .
he decided to seek information elsewhere .
i can t believe you chickened out .
i can t believe i m even considering this .
something might fall on you so be careful .
you don t seem convinced .
this river is beautiful .
i need some help here .
compared to you i m just a beginner at this game .
we go caroling every year on christmas eve .
you shouldn t have gone fishing today .
we relaxed in the living room .
i haven t seen him since then .
i m blessed .
i didn t want to get out of bed .
tom has less money than his brother does .
how can this be done ?
i m not familiar with french poets .
we re not responsible .
did you have a good sleep ?
i got nothing .
that s probably just a coincidence .
stay away from us .
i d like another cup of coffee .
they won t tell you the truth .
what would your father think ?
just try it out .
all the members were not present at the meeting yesterday .
you really are good .
i don t like talking with tom .
are you leaving ?
i didn t see much .
we don t lock our doors .
i want to know now .
tell me about your daily life .
i don t know what you re looking for .
my sister is shorter than you .
were you here last week ?
you all did good work .
let me handle it .
everyone s been evacuated .
if you try you ll succeed .
i ll finish reading this novel soon .
i just feel so lost .
i tried to do everything you asked me to do .
he jumped out of bed .
i d like to remain anonymous .
because my mother was ill i could not go there .
we re so happy you re here .
we re motivated .
the light is on .
tom has never celebrated christmas .
we re dozing off .
i paid the bill .
tom wants everyone to get out of here .
those are my books .
keep the money .
i am sure of her success .
are you talking to yourself again ?
get out of my bed .
you re still alive .
i m not offended .
she dropped out of school .
they let me go .
i hear with my ears .
i fell in love with her .
he is still in bed .
you didn t let me answer .
he said he was poor .
they can t do that .
i just remembered .
i ll talk to you about it after lunch .
do you have many friends ?
i ll always be here .
i didn t kiss anybody .
i m off duty .
i could get used to this .
i want to show you what tom gave me .
we can go to the museum .
they re able students .
something bit me .
it will work .
that s exactly what i want to hear .
the cherry blossoms are at their best .
i m sorry to have bothered you .
tom is a judge .
she found a nice tie for me .
the door is locked at nine o clock .
once a bad habit is formed it is hard to get rid of it .
cherry blossoms are very beautiful .
i never stop thinking about you .
i m a minister .
do you think that s what we should do ?
that s the way .
you ll be asleep by the time your father gets home .
i wonder why .
i don t like who you ve become .
what would you say if you were in my place ?
what an achievement !
i just got a raise .
i wish i had a roommate to hang out with .
they told me tom was dead .
i fell asleep on the train .
he has decided not to go to the meeting .
i don t have a bicycle .
the boy was searching for the lost key .
she stayed here by herself .
i got suspended for doing that .
without advice you would ve failed .
i let it fall .
it s your responsibility to finish the job .
 how much is he asking for ? a thousand euros . 
she wants to meet him again .
he said to himself i will do it . 
have you already signed the contract ?
please come here .
she loves antiques .
we re stalled .
how much did these glasses cost ?
i m not that stupid !
you re the greatest .
we have no proof .
is it possible to drink salt water ?
i have to write a letter . do you have some paper ?
the body converts extra calories into fat .
i ran so i would be on time .
could you send someone up to make the bed ?
he warned me of the danger .
he is a methodical person .
we re in the same class .
a rack of lamb makes a great meal .
were you here all night ?
i had a hunch you would do that .
why didn t you guys tell me ?
that would be a waste of her talent .
my little brother is watching tv .
no one answered .
we have a simple solution for all this .
she peeked through the curtain .
there s a place i d like to show you .
i forgot to turn off the gas !
we should finish this .
what i want is some peace and quiet .
what s the horse s name ?
there s something i d like you to see .
take the chair to your room .
i can t decode the message .
can you really swim ?
you re not my friend .
the change was immediate .
he came in spite of bad weather .
he seems to know us .
your outrage is completely justified .
did you complete the work ?
stand where you are or i ll kill you .
i m now about as tall as my father .
i d like to know where you are .
can we trust a man like that ?
i want you to drop it .
stop staring at me .
if i had more money i could move to a bigger house .
it looks painful .
tom strangled mary with a rope .
are you mentally ill ?
you must be cautious .
dry the pants on the radiator .
do you believe in miracles ?
they flunked their exams .
she refuses to say more about it .
what do you mean you can t help me ?
if it had not been for your advice i could not have succeeded .
what should we do if he happens to come late ?
she is anxious about her safety .
i can t help but feel partly responsible .
do you have the time ?
tom thought about what mary said .
you enjoyed that didn t you ?
i was new .
how much rent do you pay for the apartment ?
is that what you really want to do ?
the view is beautiful beyond words .
grandmother looked very well .
you ve wasted enough of my time .
i have your schedule here .
tom started to like mary more and more .
we couldn t do that .
do you have any pets ?
does this make me look fat ?
translate this sentence into french .
i don t believe you anymore .
please get out of my car .
he is too shy to talk to girls .
could you put those documents on my desk ?
i can t believe we ve finally finished the project .
she advised him to go to the hospital .
tom writes left handed .
take a number .
are you a ghost ?
please wait five minutes .
soon after that i began to fall asleep .
when do owls sleep ?
this computer is yours isn t it ?
you might not want to mention that .
i hope i m not boring you .
tom paused to catch his breath .
we ve already talked about that .
why didn t you call for help ?
make sure the door is locked .
look at that big hammer .
i ll tell tom the truth .
i haven t read either of his novels .
you re a talented kid .
he was named after his grandfather .
you ve been infected .
the price of oil is down this week .
there s some leftover food in the fridge .
do you have an airplane ticket back home ?
how do you prefer your eggs ?
i felt sure this would happen .
who s going to cook for us ?
i just want your love .
i should ve told tom .
whose bicycle is that ?
are you coming in or not ?
have a nice vacation .
we walked .
the button on your coat is coming off .
are you a typist ?
do you know what the real problem is ?
i know that you re very angry .
you should ve paid attention .
i was just in time for the last train .
does anybody know him ?
christmas is coming soon .
i like that answer .
go play with tom .
you re organized .
i was not drunk .
why did they hire you ?
she brushed away the dust .
all future meetings will be held in this room .
i never told you to lie .
i don t feel like partying .

i see no reason to tell you anything .
it ll be a difficult decision .
both of them started laughing .
he wants to come .
what drives you ?
she rode a camel .
you did that on your own didn t you ?
do not fear the unexpected but be prepared for it .
how did you spend christmas ?
have you gone mad ?
you re not safe here .
i m not accusing anyone of anything .
tom likes being the center of attention .
read it to me .
i want you to know how sorry i am .
he filled the bucket with water .
i said i would help you .
i think you re in danger .
i have some gifts for you .
i suppose you know all about it .
let me go !
there are a lot of beautiful places in japan .
that s too difficult for me .
let me put off my decision .
i wonder if i really should do that .
the drug must go through clinical trials before being approved .
i won t be going with you .
my car is parked not far from here .
you seemed exhausted .
you re very timid .
aren t you late ?
do you think you would ever consider going out with me ?
i almost always do that in the afternoon .
before it gets out in the media i d like to announce to all my fans that i m pregnant .
the night is dark .
you d best be home before midnight .
be nicer to your brother .
i never realized how much i would miss you .
all was calm .
i ve been tricked .
i m writing a book .
he devoted a lot of time to study .
i could tutor you .
she gave me good advice .
i can t tell you what happened .
my father spends a lot of time on his hobby .
i was young and i needed the money .
i d like to study in boston .
we all want to know why you weren t here yesterday .
i don t think there s any harm in telling you now .
do you want a drink or not ?
i didn t volunteer .
i know tom can t win .
the truth is that nothing is totally true or false .
should i make a cream pie or a pound cake ?
i want to focus on that .
you re powerless .
that looks expensive .
what do you think of his new novel ?
a gentle wind is blowing .
you don t have to sing .
you will soon get to like him .
i didn t think we would be so busy today .
where did you go to college ?
go on .
i saw a light at the end of the tunnel .
he made up the story .
is that what tom meant ?
i don t think that i need your help today .
if i weren t broke i d buy it .
there are plenty of rocks .
tom never helps me .
i should read the book .
try not to think about it .
show me your hands .
what did you do to my phone ?
have you known them for a long time ?
tom is interested .
tell me your impression of this book .
i know what happens next .
i think that s exciting .
please don t talk about me when i m gone .
how cool is this ?
i am happy to meet you .
they were attacked .
you can do it if you try .
what makes you think i m hiding something ?
it is not surprising that he was elected mayor .
you can t leave me here alone .
i don t really feel like reading .
be nicer to your sister .
i think it s time for me to consider going on a diet .
i just want to be loved .
i don t mind if you leave .
it s going to be great and exciting to be there .
this isn t a place for kids .
the students sat in a circle .
i put an advertisement in the newspaper saying my house was for sale .
she was advised by him not to go .
that may not be so easy .
would you like to meet tom ?
i asked tom why he wanted to go to boston .
i like where i live .
i heard tom gave you his grandfather s violin .
i ll see you in the morning .
today i watched a play written by a friend of mine .
this is giving me a headache .
tom fastened his seat belt .
she s busy now so she can t talk with you .
i don t take needless risks .
i ve never heard of you .
no one else was injured .
how do we find it ?
did that accident really happen last year ?
it s not an either or situation .
due to bad weather the plane was late .
that can have serious consequences .
tom is smarter than mary .
tom was a crusader .
that s a waste of time and money .
i got home a little late last night .
we can live with that .
she argued with him about money .
you know i don t dance .
i wish you a happy new year .
tom looks reluctant .
she s open minded .
she didn t want him to play poker .
she was only half alive .
are you ready ?
tom verified the date of the meeting .
i didn t know you weren t canadian .
i ll trust you .
are all of them your friends ?
the only thing that matters is that you weren t injured .
i think i can do it .
if everyone shouts at once we won t be able to hear what the prime minister has to say .
please let me explain .
tom says hi .
christmas is a wonderful time of the year .
will it rain today ?
tom brought me here .
it isn t over yet .
how much is the commission ?
the patient will soon recover from his illness .
the phone is out of order .
i m rather surprised to hear it .
can you drive me home ?
we re both writers .
someone s talking .
it was all a big mistake .
get ready quickly .
tom needs some new clothes .
this car cost me a fortune .
why are you saying goodbye ?
this was your idea .
i should clean the room .
i think we re pretty lucky .
he is planning to launch his business .
he heard his name called .
tom confuses his right with his left .
i ll walk you to the gate .
no one really knows what s going on .
see things as they are .
she s very afraid of snakes .
where s the nearest store ?
i stayed in bed one more day just to be on the safe side .
at what time is dinner served ?
confessions obtained by torture are generally worthless .
she is a college student .
the deadline is approaching .
i couldn t take that chance .
may i use your toilet ?
you don t need to panic .
a polite manner is characteristic of japanese people .
i ll try .
we re not going to make it in time .
tom never wanted to be lawyer .
you made my day .
that s why i m a bachelor .
tom handed mary a knife so she could peel the apples .
i hope we find tom .
you ve gone too far .
you need to redecorate your room .
tom turned on the lamp .
nobody knows about the plan .
the vegetation was thick and lush .
i have to change into my work clothes .
you don t need to go .
something s missing .
that was embarrassing .
this has nothing to do with that .
i suggest we hurry .
i forgot the pin number .
dry your eyes .
the population of london is much greater than that of any other british city .
he suggested that the meeting be put off till monday .
your hair looks nice .
they gave us very little trouble .
i don t appreciate being interrupted .
we were just about to call you .
i eat dinner after work .
you have to go .
i m hardly ever home .
i had something else planned .
stop treating me like a child .
i ve got a good reason not to like tom .
tom didn t tell mary he couldn t speak french .
don t your neighbors ever complain ?
i did it in a couple of days .
i don t want you to wake him up .
you don t have what it takes to be a leader .
you made an error .
what did you do with that car ?
you aren t tom .
we gave a party in celebration of his th birthday .
is there anything i can do ?
just be glad you re ok .
we ll dine together and then go to the theater .
are you sure there s no meat in this soup ?
i m not really asleep just dozing .
no one followed me .
tom stared blankly .
how come you didn t call me last night ?
you should be ready for the worst .
you told me that you were just friends .
i know that it s highly unlikely that you d ever want to go out with me but i still need to ask at least once .
maybe you could draw me a map ?
it is not because i hate him but because i love him .
the tv doesn t work .
i m running a little late .
do you want dessert ?
i don t have a cat .
i m losing .
you were right about this .
i liked that wine .
how about you ?
it s time for you to get up .
i should ve warned you earlier .
japanese is our mother tongue .
this river is two hundred kilometers long .
cross the street .
never mind !
the only thing i have now are memories .
that looks good .
tom tried to stay quiet .
i had a call from her for the first time in a long time .
now that we re alone let s have fun .
we spoke briefly .
it doesn t matter to me whether or not i make money doing this .
do you remember seeing me before ?
i have so much work to do that i have to put off my trip .
i would like to improve my english pronunciation .
because of you i m having problems with my blood pressure .
she is expecting a baby in june .
compare your sentence with the one on the blackboard .
you re very clever .
he is equal to the task .
why are you so insecure ?
we must never do this again .
meeting girls is hard .
i can t handle them .
i m the team s head coach .
it looks like i came at a bad time .
she told him to stop .
i ve got a ton of work to do .
tom needs our help .
what s your nationality ?
i couldn t stand it any longer .
you re a pig .
this is why i hate him .
it was just a matter of time .
come quick !
could i borrow some money ?
we have had few typhoons this autumn .
i want to talk .
i understand your language .
the cup broke .
i ll ignore that .
this report is very sloppily written .
he finally arrived .
where s the catch ?
i want the two of you to quit arguing .
i m not in favor of this plan .
you re awesome .
do you have health insurance ?
we bought a round table .
i m a real man .
i want to name the baby after you .
how would you feel if your wife left you ?
you don t need to know .
everyone has stopped working .
the monkey came down .
the neighbor s dog is always barking .

tom left all the windows closed .
how many kids do you have ?
i wish that we could spend more time together .
no one told me that he had failed .
please remain seated .
she s busy now and can t talk with you .
tom can t come today .
have you ever dreamed of me ?
they deported tom .
where do you go for christmas ?
you can t pretend that it didn t happen .
you know some french don t you ?
why don t you just study a little harder ?
i hate to see you so miserable .
i want to be here with you .
tom is only thirty years old .
that s sort of nice .
that accident was due to his carelessness .
that s not something i want to think about right now .
i m sorry to see tom go .
why don t you tell me what you remember ?
they slept in the same bed .
tom is out of danger .
some things can t be forgotten .
i m sure tom was involved .
he focused on his studies .
let s get this over with quickly .
turn right at the next intersection .
i plan on being there in person .
when i run i get sweaty .
i think the same as they do .
the museum is closed now .
tom seems to be hyperventilating .
this looks kind of cute .
i don t have any pencils .
no sooner had he met his family than he burst into tears .
we re dealing with major problems in this city .
turn on the fan .
he is just an amateur .
he called off the trip .
he thought of a good idea .
make yourselves comfortable .
i didn t fall in love .
you do seem a little on edge .
are you a model ?
everyone should go .
you start .
i have to know why .
i feel like another beer .
we know all about you .
that seems highly unlikely .
she advised him to be punctual .
what ll the weather be like tomorrow ?
she breaks a dish every time she washes dishes .
he met an unexpected obstacle .
i owe somebody something .
she wanted a piece of cake but there was none left .
i m counting on you .
this doesn t make sense .
sorry something went wrong .
i m getting sleepy again .
may i be excused for a minute ?
i m about to lose my mind .
i ve never actually seen a real cow .
i ll be sixteen years old next month .
that man looks vaguely familiar .

japan is not rich in natural resources .
aliens are often depicted with dark almond shaped eyes .
hot weather will continue so please watch out for food poisoning .
will you be hiring any part time help ?
is it ok to drink beer on your university campus ?
we hope to reach the summit before it gets dark .
i know that tom isn t a canadian .

he is endowed with many talents .
do you know what love is ?
when i was your age i had a job .
your threats don t scare me at all .
i can lend you some money if you like .
i exercised .
i m not surprised you don t know the answer .

loosen up .
i don t take any medication .
i ve always hated biology .
the radio is too loud . can t you turn it down a little ?
i never should ve let you go home alone last night .
i don t think i can get you to understand how difficult that is .
the house looked very dismal .
she had been sick for a week when i visited her .
she has a very good figure .
i came here to meet you .
we re waiting for you to leave .
you may take anything you like .
it s strange that nobody knows us .
have you done your christmas shopping ?
am i too old to learn yoga ?
it s too late now .
flattery will get you nowhere .

we re normal .
he s still single .
he is very sensitive to cold .
what shall i do next ?
it s all a big misunderstanding .

remove your coat and empty your pockets .
whatever you say .
i ve got a rope in my trunk .

i made a list of people i wanted to invite to my party .
did you volunteer us ?
i must hurry .
have you finished writing that song you ve been working on ?
that s happening far too often .
is there another word for synonym ?
don t you watch old movies ?
i think that s a good plan .
i was trapped .
tom s silent .
how do you put up with the noise ?
we never learned what happened or why .
are all these books yours ?
it is life that teaches us not school .
you shouldn t say that kind of thing when children are around .
bring it back when you are through .
the police compared the fingerprints on the gun with those on the door .
i am deeply grateful to you for your kindness .

he is sadly mistaken .
we are faced with a host of problems .
i forgot to do what tom asked me to do .
you must study french .
this building belongs to my family .
if you want me to help you all you have to do is ask .

my mother didn t mention it .

tom likes skiing too .
we walked up and down the streets of kyoto .
he asked me to .
were you able to do everything you wanted to get done ?
she spent most of her life taking care of poor people .
i have decided to weigh myself every day starting today .
she fell down and hurt her knee .
how long do you have to eat lunch ?
do i seem old to you ?
i m not gambling anymore .
i can t believe you did that by yourself .
i didn t know you were awake .
tom drank straight from the bottle .
i was absolutely stunned .
we have things all worked out .
tom showed mary the photo .
cats have nine lives .
this is not disneyland .
this isn t a safe place .
i m wearing sunglasses .

he denied having done it .
they re involved .
the bicycle is mine .
are you all alone ?
do you feel like you are going to throw up ?
do you think i m ugly ?
he had an accident at work .
he is standing on the hill .
we started hugging and kissing each other .
you never told me about this before .
kids do stupid things .
he frowns on his wife s wasting money .
well you ve convinced me .
we don t want to take the time now .
i don t live around here .
you are too young to travel alone .
he doesn t have any proof .
that might not be easy .
i m delighted to meet you .
among the items found in the purse was the photo of a man .
he came to tokyo at the age of three .
he lost his way in the woods .
the first time i held my girlfriend s hand was in the haunted house .
she was talking all the time .

you may use my car .
i feel a whole lot better today .
i work as a consultant .
isn t this place great ?
this is the lady i spoke of yesterday .
tom rubbed his forehead .
sorry i didn t reply sooner .
he hurried to the station .
english is a universal language and is used all over the world .
i fell in the pool .
the students laughed .
you shouldn t have followed me .
tom needed us .
tom prepared a healthy meal for mary .
he told me good things about you .
 i agree with him . so do i . 
she hid the letter carefully so no one would see it .
no one works there anymore .
tom claims he won .
i just want you to tell me why you lied .
tom said that you tried to kill him .
i want to speak to a lawyer .
he speaks english with a strong german accent .
he s a liar .
dad extended his legs on the sofa .
i saw tom sitting in the third row .

the room is spacious and light .
you re right about that .
i hate the sound of my voice .
why did you say such a thing ?
he stopped smoking last year .
there are several forms of government .
you don t have the nerve .
i ll be happy to answer your question .
you missed the point entirely .
tom remembers you .
she is playing with a doll .
this is interesting .
before we say goodbye there s something i d like to ask you .

you do like living dangerously .
this program is brought to you by the following sponsors .
you have no evidence .

i m sorry but i don t have any small change .
life without love is meaningless .
both of the windows were broken .
the cia is watching you .
he longed for his mother .

your cat will survive .
tom never takes me seriously .
were you happy with the results ?
if you want to sell your old sofa why not put an advertisement in the local paper ?
he denounced all forms of dishonesty in government .
that twenty kilometer run really wiped me out .

i wouldn t have made it without you .
we re working to fix this bug .

his mother sighed with relief .
i come from a long line of doctors .
i didn t know the city and what s more i couldn t speak a word of the language .

everyone got something for christmas .
i see they ve put you to work .
i believe we can get that done .
could you reduce the price a little ?
all her money went to her nephew .
i wash my hands before eating lunch .
manuela s clothes are very stylish .
tom is the one who knows what needs to be done .
you must be a good cook .

tom s grandfather couldn t read .
i feel like being alone .

he s painting his house .
i didn t ask you to stay with me .

i m starved .
doing that would be a mistake .

is that all you want ?
you ll get into trouble .
i m sorry .

i need to hear it .
i wrote down where i was working .
i know tom is a light eater .
i d rather not comment on that .
you must be very proud .

i mistook him for his brother .
how many people were present at the meeting ?
he s crazy about her .
i think that tom is still breathing .
tom must ve realized it was a rhetorical question because he didn t answer .
i wanted to buy you something nice .
he showed me the ropes .
i m not sure that you re ready .
even without makeup she s very cute .
this book isn t as heavy as that one .
don t you want to know where i was ?
that proposal may be a way to kill two birds with one stone but we also have to be careful not to get greedy and spoil everything .
where did you get all this from ?
tom will kill me .
that s a possible explanation .
be brief .
she pulled down the blinds .
why didn t somebody call me ?
i interpreted her silence as a refusal .
i walked my dog .
will you take me home ?
they accused me of being a liar .
i ll give you a present .
i m telling you the truth .
did you really dance with tom ?
the goods were transported by ship .
have you been told why we didn t hire you ?
what would i do without you ?
she took a trip to paris .

it was a big explosion .
nothing would make me happier than to see you happy .

everything was very good .
i love you more deeply than i can say .
what are you guys looking at ?

we stayed at a nice hotel .

today is a holiday .
do you really want to lead this kind of life ?
maybe he likes you too .
tom usually goes to school by bus .

the shop was closed .
i really appreciate you picking me up .
i m calling because i ve lost my credit card .
is tom aware of what mary did ?
i m glad you re coming .
tom was given a warm reception .
we appreciate your cooperation .
we need to make sure that this is true .
don t fret .
i feel like doing something different today .
stop singing that song .
you don t have to explain .
i ve seen tom on tv many times .
life in prison is worse than the life of an animal .
what do you feel most proud of ?
it s not going to end well .
tom seldom makes mistakes when writing in french .
be careful about what you eat .
you should relax a little .

i think there s no point in trying to convince her .
what can you make out ?
my car needs a new battery .
i have problems concentrating .
hand it to me .
you have problems .
nobody lives in this house .
we ll get you a place to stay .
i ve done it .
are you suggesting that it s beyond my comprehension ?
quakers believe that all people are equal .
tom bought a book .
my work is not complete yet .
why did you come here today ?
talking in the library is not allowed .
it is abnormal to have the heart on the right side .
you re generous .

nobody believes that anymore .
she got through her work before five .
i know how busy you ve been .
tom goes abroad every year .
i want you to put in a good word for me .
i see they ve put you to work .
i don t even want to think about what could happen .
she was overcome with happiness .
even monkeys fall from trees .
now is the time .
who else helped you ?
tom loved to do that .
am i getting sloppy or what ?
did you hear the roar of the lions ?
am i the only one who agrees with you ?
i assume that s what you want .
i dipped my finger into the honey .
you talk as if you were the boss .
she loves me .
do you really believe this ?
i lied to both of you .
that s illegal .
i just can t wait to do that .
i ve already filed my report .

the dog will not harm you .
will there be any permanent damage ?
you have tennis elbow . soak your arm in warm water .
bread is made from wheat .
may i eat this apple ?
plants die without water .
i think you had better stick to your present job .
what gave you that idea ?
tom scares me .
i have to dress up .
i don t want to kill you .
that guy drives me crazy .
i m very sleepy now .
why doesn t anybody help you ?

you shouldn t have lent money to tom .
he has a good record as a businessman .
i don t complain often .
i need more time .
tell me about your children .
she gave considerable thought to what to do with the money .
he approached the station .
she should have arrived home by now .

how are you going to manage ?
i know you re thinking about me .
city life suits me very well .
they re not coming back .
i want to get off this island .
we re almost there .
i don t want to meet your parents .
i just got up . give me a few minutes to get ready .
i m not weird .
the rumor isn t true .

keep away from the dog .
they could not find work at home .
i thought you might change your mind .

the bill was approved by an overwhelming majority .
don t do that .
is tom very mad at me ?
we had fun didn t we ?
tom comes from a good family .
generally speaking little girls are fond of dolls .
they have nothing to eat .
she managed to keep up appearances .
my blood pressure is quite high .
just give me a little time .
i must help my mother .
can you all understand tom ?
i ll stay out of your way .
i had to park two blocks from here .
i hope it helps .
i turned off the lamp and went to sleep .
he took part in the race .
where is your luggage ?
the road is straight for over ten miles .
i thought you d be grateful .
i don t have anything to say to you .
wear warm clothes or you could get sick .
are you leaving today ?
i was in agony .
did she say it ?
is this seat free ?
he can t afford to buy a new car .
i was going to suggest the following possibility .
consider the successes that have been achieved by tired discouraged people who decided to give it one more try .
he shaves four times a week .
the swelling has gone down .
she knelt beside him and asked him what his name was .
i wondered if i could do such a thing .
we could live in peace here .
tom doesn t understand this .
go wake tom up .
we re going to need a little more money .
do you know how long they ve been married ?
tom is a football player .
i hope i didn t make you feel uncomfortable .
i don t know why and i don t care .
would you like one ?
tuck your shirt in .

i was frustrated .
i think there has been some misunderstanding here .
you can dance until midnight .
how many hours of sleep do you need ?
i have got to go now .
they met for the first time in london .
he called me a taxi .
i wish to be alone for a while .
it s the least we can do .
tom arrived late as usual .
did we wake you up ?
tom is boring isn t he ?
i hate being bored .
if it snows tomorrow i ll build a snowman .
you re the teacher .
will you dance with me ?
i had a late lunch .
this is a christmas present for you .
i think this tastes good .
isn t that annoying ?
shouting isn t singing .
i ve been hoping to meet you .
tom said you were meeting him for lunch .
there was not enough fuel .
what do you want to know ?
he began to cry .
not all people like dogs .
how long will that be ?
my father can speak french but my mother can t .
i don t often drink tequila .
my husband is a good man .
what happened to tom ?
i must be blind .
i don t want to talk anymore .
who s your favorite player ?
can you help me a little ?
did you try this key ?
do you want me to walk you home ?
i corrected myself .
we all need to stay together .
let me think for a minute .
they make a great team .
the young man lives in an old house .
tom is from a small town .
you may stay here if you like as long as you keep quiet .
which student went out ?
would you do it with me ?
tom kept driving .
i m sure tom will be home soon .
what is it you do ?
he s new in town .
call off your dogs .
i ve never seen anything like it .
that s better than nothing .
he was killed by a land mine .
don t push it .
we all missed the target .
i want you to analyze this .
that s a tough question to answer .
don t forget to wear a tie .
a seam on the blanket has unraveled .
he smells bad .
you never cease to amaze me .
we have a lot of things in common .
the doctor arrived in the nick of time .
look who s there .
i am just a humble teacher .
do you have something to show me ?
i was a criminal .
he spent the evening reading a book .
i hope you ll come back soon .
i m just watching tv .
his doctor advised him to quit smoking .
i like your glasses .
what s that dog doing ?
do you know who this car here belongs to ?
where do you think we came from ?
i m heartbroken .
i haven t decided what to do yet .
the price isn t important .
it s a luxury we can t afford .
i haven t eaten mexican food in a long time .
you can stay here as long as you like .
i thought that you were able to speak french .
she spent all afternoon cooking .
the man who is constantly making decisions and being compelled to alter them gets nowhere .
you re skinny .
you re too stupid to live .
he said good night to his parents .
i can talk to him for hours .
tom has no conception of what it s like to be in love .
i m the only one who survived .
i can t wait till summer .
the wind is blowing from the north .
i don t like your friends .
what has become of the book i put here a few minutes ago ?
tom is definitely feeling better today .
they entertained us at dinner last night .
even tom wasn t able to answer the teacher s questions .
i wish to see my father .
we re wasting valuable time here .
tell us all the gossip .
tom is going to do something about it .
what should i be doing ?
will you put down that paper and listen to me ?
we can t do anything until we get back to the office .
i didn t mean to offend you .
i m old enough to drink .
the doctor was not sure what the trouble was .
my new assistant is eager to learn the ropes .
i thought you wanted to wait .
it s not new .
tom gave his father a tie on father s day .
the rumors were true .
better bread without butter than cake without freedom .
come play with us .
i hope you get better soon .
i can t excuse his laziness .
i wish he would make up his mind one way or other .
a child needs a mother .
just be careful .
i met tom on my way to school .
do you think it s going to snow tomorrow ?
is it bad ?
i d like to discuss this with your boss .

i m sure tom would be happy to help .
i m truly sorry .
it s not personal .
tom is used to making speeches .
you ll find yourself in a miserable situation .
i know that you aren t stupid .
is that your answer ?
don t say anything unless it s important .
i love you the most .
my computer crashed and now it won t start up .

tom stepped away .
they ate and drank wine .
look at that !
this one is ours .
it s very hard for me to trust anyone .

i ve never been so embarrassed .
i m not sure i follow what you re saying .

human beings differ from animals in that they can think and speak .

she was equal to the job .
he denied having said such a thing .
tom wears jeans every day .
i want an explanation and i want it now .

tom started chanting .
tom tightened the knot .
how long will you stay in kyoto ?
let me in . i have to talk to you .
i won t stay here alone .
do you have any messages for me ?
i was sitting behind tom .
you are old enough to know better than to act like that .
he couldn t stand the bitterness of the coffee .
she is engaged to a rich man .
that s what you think .
i ate nothing but bread and butter .
i got busy .
tom always works hard .
my little brother always sleeps with his teddy bear .
tom didn t know who mary was .
parents teach their children that it s wrong to lie .
i don t think that tom knows who painted that picture .
there is going to be a storm .
i had expected him at the meeting .
i m here to ask for your help .
i feel the same way as you do .
i d like a bottle of water .
i know they ll all want to help you .
tom couldn t find the words to express how he was feeling .
why don t you admit your mistake ?
i m an adult .
i m better at writing french than speaking it .

he fixed the problem in a jiffy .
we worry about your future .
i want to retire .

he can read .
i never thought i d ever see you again .

he ran to school arriving in time .
i can t see what you mean .
they re fearless .

they killed tom as an example to the other prisoners .
i feel terrible about the way things happened .
i was hoping you d know .
he s away on vacation .
i know a faster way to do this .
why do you want that anyway ?
he was exiled from his own country .
you re disgusting .
will you leave tomorrow ?
can we come with you ?
i like music particularly classical music .
we found it very hard going back to our base camp in the blizzard .
turn it off .
i was worried .
you have to stop worrying .
i ve had enough of your lying .
dad i m taking the car out for a drive .
the clock struck ten .
i am sure that he will become a great singer .
i think it s time for me to abandon that plan .
i d like to get a little shut eye .
you shouldn t always follow the crowd .

only takeuchi didn t accept the invitation .
in christianity jesus is believed to be the son of god .
it s the dry season here .

they did a good job .
i know how hard it s been .

i want your name and badge number .
you could hear a pin drop .
i don t think that i snore .
i felt like such an idiot .
a person with common sense would never do this kind of thing .
mary asked her family for a loan .
why are they doing this ?
i know tom is a vegetarian .
you re the one i ve been waiting for .
you gotta get more organized .
i m afraid to go .
they studied the map to find a short cut .

i m not nervous .
i like hanging out here .
don t be sorry .
has he lived here for two years ?
he lived there all by himself .
tom is not as young as i am .

where did you get all that money from ?
i thought we should leave .

i want to go there once more .
i don t believe you . you re always telling lies .

everybody hates you .
i just want to be loved .
how did you come up with such a good idea ?
he mailed a letter home .
it s very kind of you to say so .

it is under the chair .
what s wrong with parading around your own house naked ?
the whole nation wants peace .
i learn a lot from my father .

i want to see you smile .
my father cut wood with a saw .

it s quite clear to me that this is the truth .
hello tom . good morning .
this is the key that opened that door .
i m very proud of all of you .
you live here alone don t you ?
she s just a child .
you have no idea .
i was to have finished the work yesterday .
i haven t eaten in a while .
she left home with everything she owned .
she invited him in .
do you still have feelings for her ?
can you validate this parking ticket ?
who ll take care of the dog while we re gone ?
please see to it that the dog doesn t go out .
i think he likes you .
we just want a second opinion .
in a sense you are right .
does anybody hear me ?
are all of them your friends ?
this one is similar to that one .
time s up .
here he comes .
that should suffice .
i can t stand being laughed at in front of others .
he will advise you on that matter .
