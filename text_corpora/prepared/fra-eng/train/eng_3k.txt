she told him to try harder .
i will help you .
the air conditioner is out of order .
not only did he teach school but he wrote novels .
i thought about you the other day .
the family is the most basic unit of society .

what s this key for ?
i hate all of them .
he went back home .
i can t bear the thought of her with another man .
tom said he was busy .
i didn t know that we weren t supposed to do that .

my shoes are smaller than yours .
i think tom is untrustworthy .

the atomic number for iron is .
my grandparents died before i was born .
she whipped out her pistol .
he frowns on his wife s wasting money .
without your help he would fail .
tom thought you d do that .
they fell .

i wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper .
how about playing golf this afternoon ?
i will wait for you at the bus stop .

tom played the piano and mary sang .
i heard it on the radio .

everything s changing .
that can be a problem .
is that unusual ?
the rice needs more salt .

there is a small garden in front of my house .
it s no good talking about it .
you don t look very good .
who s taking responsibility for the loss ?
we debated the problem .
our team is gaining ground .
there was nothing you could have done .

why did you come over here ?
he showed his photograph album to me .
she pointed at him .
he dropped in on me .
my grandfather s picture is on the wall .
i don t care what anyone says .
tom gets sick quite often .

i think i ll need an umbrella today .
it s like being a kid in a candy store .
he looked bewildered .
tom disappeared .

she was busy with housework .
i know that tom and only tom can do that .
tom doesn t take vacations .
they re cool .
can i keep this ?
the company produces soy sauce and other food products .
his policies were too progressive .
are you sure this is a good idea ?
we spent the night in a cheap hotel .
i ll be counting on you to bring the drinks .
we also found this .
i don t want to be seen talking to you .
tom seemed ok .
did you do yesterday s homework ?
the top is turning clockwise .
you re perfect for me .
i won t give them to you .
why didn t the police notify us ?
tom told me that he didn t feel like eating .
tom took the job .

i know where you live .
i watched a movie .
i have to do it by myself .
we all jumped into the water at the same time .
where have you been all afternoon ?
the problem is that you re not canadians .
tom sat listening .
he looked through a magazine .
what if something goes wrong ?
you may go anywhere .
mastering a foreign language calls for patience .
listen to what your father says .
what you say makes no sense .

flour is made into bread .
a passenger fainted but the stewardess brought him around .

let s say no more about it .
did you get the flowers i sent you ?
i found it necessary to get up early every morning .
you chose a good one .
tom asked mary to work for him .
in singapore one way to punish a criminal is to whip him or her .
how cold is it in boston right now ?
it was night .
i think you should leave tom alone .
a boy of seventeen is often as tall as his father .
it kept raining for three days .
i don t know who that youngster is .
i m speaking .
when will you get through with work ?
it s great that you were able to come .
tom can do anything he wants .

you and i are the same age .
there s no money .
i can t believe we finally made it .

tom is photogenic isn t he ?
i am near the station .
this water isn t drinkable .
i m not happy about it .
i think it s cruel to keep a cat indoors .

tom didn t tell me this .
my grandparents were born in the last century .
do you know where the bus stop is ?
he is having coffee now .
she was captured trying to steal jewelry .
i m sure the two of you agree .

you re not as smart as me .
we set up the tent next to the river .
i made a fortune .
i ve never been in love before .
i just got tenure .
don t get too excited .
this old building isn t worth fixing up . it would be better to tear it down .
i really like this restaurant .
it s going to be close .
i can t open this bottle .
tom carried the suitcases for me .
i ll go home .
everything is changing .
i know tom will be supportive .
perhaps she doesn t remember my birthday .
i didn t think you were needed .
tom nervously entered .
she forgot to feed her dog .
which book is yours ?
this company uses cheap labor to increase its profit margins .
can i do anything ?
pretend you re me .
why were you laughing ?
the soldiers are ready for battle .
the airplane took off ten minutes ago .
do you drink wine ?
are you sure we ve never met before ?
i ll let you know when i need you .
is there a flight in the morning ?
it was unpardonable .
do you think we should abandon ship ?
what are you trying to hide from me ?
were you able to solve the problem ?
tom still can t swim very well .
you re safe .
not everyone likes that book .
i m practically an adult now .
what made tom do that ?
you are free to leave any time you wish .
go get a drink of water .
translate this text .
he was kind enough to invite me .
when your resources are limited you have to prioritize .
we weren t even in australia at that time .
he is still having doubts .
hey it doesn t work that way .
i don t think i should do that .
what do you say ?
his accent suggests he is a foreigner .
don t look at me with such sad eyes .
where did you spend your holidays ?
no one has come forward to claim responsibility for what happened .
these clothes suit you .
have you received a letter from him ?
the boys are excited .
have they spotted you ?
i m not supposed to help you .
you re sneaky .
could you write it down please ?
he couldn t help laughing at it .
your face is dirty .

my sister became a college student .
i met her in london for the first time .

he asked me what my name was .
do you feel like having a drink ?
tom doesn t know how strong you are .
what s going on around here ?
do you think you can manage to keep things going until i get back ?
tom will never forgive you .

i went there out of curiosity .
i m not quite finished yet .
i thought we d agreed that you wouldn t do that anymore .
he can speak russian as well .
who is your english teacher ?
i like all of them .
just stay away from my daughter .
i think it s unlikely that i ll be able to pass my driving test .
did you come by boat ?
i ll do what the boss tells me .
they said you were fired .
i think that tom lied to me .
i m totally confused .
i already did that .
tell me you didn t do this .
you told me that you were tired .
the conflict between blacks and whites in the city became worse .
can you read what that says ?
how did you meet him ?

no one wanted to talk about it .
it s an important step .
tom looks angry .

we were younger then .
i m not the only one who got here early .
i left one of my books at school .

i hope you can be a better father than i was .
i was watching tv at this time yesterday .
i like this one .
it would be good to sleep even for just a little bit .
she really likes cats a lot .
this is a dangerous road .

i want to teach you something .
this is a tight election .
have you ever cheated on an exam ?
they found him guilty .
i love my new class .
i ve never talked about it .
your memory is good .
the fluctuation in prices caused a financial crisis .
tom and mary split up after their son died .
i hope you have a merry christmas .
i m hanging a picture of my grandmother on the wall .
the laborers formed a human barricade .
how long did you stay in boston ?
it felt like a dream .
i don t know if it will be fine tomorrow but if it is fine we ll go on a picnic .
why did you buy that ?
the streets aren t safe at night .
he saw a light far away .
his car was stuck in knee deep snow .
i thought his opinion was relevant .

it was cumbersome .
the aim of this game is to explode all the bombs on the screen .
let me tell you everything i know .
did your uncle let you drive his car ?
he promised not to say it .
